# Team Division of Labor:

- Final Split of Work:
  - AI difficulty level – Jialei
  - Bug fixing - Qingyang
  - Scoreboard and Special shots - Jialei and Qingyang
  - Documentation and helping with all areas – FeiShian

# Challenges:

- Team KRAAG uses ARCADE 2.1.3 for the team project and for some reason it is not available on Windows and Linux machine
  so we spend lots of time to figure it out.
- Totally the new programming language to all of us, none of us has the experience with Python before.
- The documentation command given by Team KRAAG is not allowed 
- Team KRAAG's sound effect is not working on MacOS, so we must have to code together to test our code, we need to solve the time conflict among team members
- The logic for their program is kind of hard to understand for every team member
- Github sometimes did not allow user to resolve conflict, sometimes team member need to upload files on github
- Cannot figure out a way to customized size for a new window due to lack of python coding skills

# Features not in the Demo:

- No sound effect on demo
- GUI display for scoreboard
- There is no go back button if user wants to make some changes

# Retrospective:

- The number of py files could be less, there are a few files that could be replace by class
- None of us is good at python, which causes wasting a lot of time on something not necessary
- Should make the program can ran on most of machine or platform
- In the future, team needs to create a program that can at least ran on lab machine
